# aurora_selection_analysis
This repository holds code used for analysing SELEX NGS data

Notebooks are named according to the figures they make in a manuscript which soon will (hopefully) be a publication.

Input data for all notebooks are preprocessed NGS amplicon data. All datasets are in the format of a tsv file with two columns. Second column being a unique sequence and the second column being a read number of that sequence.
