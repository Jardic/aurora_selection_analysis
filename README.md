# Aurora selection analysis
This repository holds code used for analysing NGS data from a couple of different in vitro selection experiments. All these results are tied to a single deoxyribozyme called Aurora. 

The two folders in this repository correspond to two different publications. 

In the first publication (folder called selection and reselection), we seleced a deoxyribozyme called Aurora. We also did a reselection (library made by using a 21% mutagenesis on a sequence selected in the previous step). 

In the second publication (folder called secondary_structure_library), we used a unique way of encoding sequences with a 'secondary structure library'. We show the advantages of this kind of library design experimentally and implement an ML pipeline designed to predict the CPM values of sequences but also explore the sequence space not sampled in our datasets with the help of a trained neural network.
